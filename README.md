# wdc_login

This repo contains all of the code used to create this application. 
All private keys have been removed. This includes a Google json file and a Google Maps API key.
You can get the Json file needed by following the YouTube link below. 

I would recommend cloning this repo but then recreating it yourself using your own setup. 

The project uses Google Firebase. Firestore is used as the database.

The login process was set up following this series of videos:

This should also give enough of a basis to follow through and understand how Flutter works with Firebase. 

The database should be as follows:

contacts -> email, message, name

users -> address, houseType, name, recBin, userPin, waste1, waste2, waste3, wasteBin

waipa -> date, weight


This should be all the info you need to replicate this yourself. Please contact me if there are any questions.
